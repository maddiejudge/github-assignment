This repository contains an analysis of monthly avearage rainfall data in Oxford and Melborne from 1955 to 2015.

Descriptions of the data can be found in data

To run this analysis, you need to use two scripts. The first script combines data from Oxford and Melborne and the second script can run the plot to visualise changes in average rainfall. These two R scripts can be found using the following command:

1. 
```
Rscript src/combine.data.R
```
The input data is in data and the results are in output


2. 
```
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```
The input data is in output and the results are in output
