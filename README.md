This repository contains an analysis of changes in rainfall in Oxford and Melborne.

To run this analysis, you first need to use the combine.data source to combine the two datasets. Using this combined dataset, you can then run the make.plot.R function. These two R scripts can be found using the following command:

```
Rscript src/combine.data.R
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```

The input data is in `data` and the results are in `out`.
